Project made for my own training. It's a connection between two of my passions: python programming and indonesian language. 

Currently it does not contain all functionalities which I want to provide (especially GUI) but I'll improve it in a short time. The main purpose of this project was to learn how to write programs in Python properly (it was my first Python project ever).
